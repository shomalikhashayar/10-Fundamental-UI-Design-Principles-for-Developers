Most users only notice the UI design of an app or software when something goes wrong. For this reason, we can say that good UI design is almost invisible, leaving the user free to get down to work without interruption. And as diverse as UI design projects can be, all good examples of UI design tend to follow the same basic golden rules.

Eager to [learn UI design](https://uixwithme.com/blog/what-is-ui-ux-design/) or improve your existing skills? Take a look at the most important UI design principles to follow for a fully seamless—and virtually imperceptible—user experience.

<h2>10 essential UI design principles</h2>

Effective user interface design is about removing as many obstacles, bottlenecks, stumbling blocks, and potential causes of confusion as possible from the [user experience](https://uixwithme.com/blog/ux-is-not-new/). Above all, the aim is to create an environment that all users find fluid and intuitive to navigate; allowing them to achieve their objectives with a minimum of fuss.

Every UI design project is different of course. Especially when it comes to the finer details. And what works for a mobile app, for instance, won’t necessarily be the right solution for desktop software or a website. Yet the general principles of good UI design remain consistent across all platforms and projects.

What follows is a series of fundamental UI design principles that can—indeed should—be applied to almost every UI design project you work on. Ignore these golden rules at your peril!

*1. Keep the UI design simple
*2. Predict and preempt
*3. Put the user in the driving seat
*4. Be methodical and consistent
*5. Avoid unnecessary complexity
*6. Provide clear signposts
*7. Be tolerant of mistakes
*8. Give relevant feedback
*9. Prioritize functions
*10. Design the UI for accessibility
